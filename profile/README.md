# Infrastructure Systems Modelling

This GitHub organisation contains open-source models and analysis codes from a number of 
research projects, organisations and collaborations.

We run out of [OPSIS](https://opsis.eci.ox.ac.uk/), the Oxford Programme for Sustainable Infrastructure Systems,
at the University of Oxford in the UK&mdash;though we study places and work with people from all around the world.

OPSIS provides research and education to enable sustainable and resilient infrastructure. We analyse 
energy, transport, water and telecommunications systems and their interactions with the natural 
environment, people and the economy.

What about the name? [NISMOD](https://nismod.github.io/nismod2/), the National Infrastructure Systems Model,
was originally developed by the Infrastrucure Transitions Research Consortium
([ITRC](https://www.itrc.org.uk/)) between 2009-2020, with various components: for long-term planning in the UK, 
infrastructure planning for sustainable development, and infrastructure risk and resilience assessment.
